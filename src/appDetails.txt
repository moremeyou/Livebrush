Livebrush is a unique motion-based drawing tool. Use the speed of your brush to toss graphics around the screen or elegantly swing the brush around your cursor. 

Over 100 styles and decorations. Export lines you draw as vector files for use in other graphics applications. Easily modify or create your styles while learning each setting using the convenient style preview. 

Developers can also use Actionscript to dynamically control or augment brush movements.
